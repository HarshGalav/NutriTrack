# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Barcode Scanner feature will enable users to quickly add packaged food items to their nutrition tracking by scanning product barcodes with their device camera. This feature will integrate with existing nutrition databases to automatically populate food information, significantly reducing manual data entry and improving the accuracy of nutrition tracking for packaged foods.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a nutrition tracker user, I want to scan barcodes on food packages, so that I can quickly add accurate nutrition information without manual entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the barcode scanner THEN the system SHALL activate the device camera with barcode detection overlay
2. WHEN a valid food barcode is detected THEN the system SHALL decode the barcode number automatically
3. WHEN the barcode is successfully decoded THEN the system SHALL query nutrition databases to retrieve product information
4. WHEN product information is found THEN the system SHALL display the food name, nutrition facts, and serving size information
5. WHEN no product information is found THEN the system SHALL display a "Product not found" message with option to manually enter details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust serving sizes for scanned products, so that I can accurately track the amount I actually consumed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product information is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the default serving size and nutrition values
2. WHEN the user modifies the serving size THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate all nutrition values proportionally
3. WHEN the user confirms the serving size THEN the system SHALL save the meal with the adjusted nutrition information
4. IF the serving size is invalid or zero THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent saving

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the barcode scanner to work reliably in different lighting conditions, so that I can scan products anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera is activated THEN the system SHALL provide adequate lighting controls or flash options
2. WHEN lighting is poor THEN the system SHALL display helpful tips for better scanning
3. WHEN the barcode is blurry or unreadable THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to adjust camera position
4. WHEN scanning takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL offer manual barcode entry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and edit scanned product information before saving, so that I can ensure accuracy and add personal notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display all nutrition details in an editable form
2. WHEN the user modifies any nutrition values THEN the system SHALL save the custom values for that meal entry
3. WHEN the user adds notes or descriptions THEN the system SHALL store them with the meal record
4. WHEN the user saves the meal THEN the system SHALL add it to their daily nutrition log with timestamp

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the barcode scanner to integrate seamlessly with my existing meal logging workflow, so that I can use it alongside other food entry methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the barcode scanner THEN it SHALL be available from the main meal entry interface
2. WHEN a product is scanned and saved THEN it SHALL appear in the user's meal history for easy re-logging
3. WHEN the user views their daily nutrition summary THEN scanned items SHALL be included in all calculations
4. WHEN the user views nutrition trends THEN scanned meals SHALL contribute to weekly and monthly analytics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline for previously scanned items, so that I can log familiar products without internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product is successfully scanned THEN the system SHALL cache the product information locally
2. WHEN the same barcode is scanned offline THEN the system SHALL retrieve information from local cache
3. WHEN offline and barcode is not cached THEN the system SHALL queue the request for when connection is restored
4. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL process queued barcode lookups automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during the scanning process, so that I know the system is working and what actions to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scanner is active THEN the system SHALL display a clear viewfinder with scanning guidelines
2. WHEN a barcode is detected THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation (highlight or animation)
3. WHEN processing the barcode THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with progress feedback
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions
5. WHEN scanning is successful THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback before showing product details
